How to Play

Players initially place their pieces on their respective home rows. Gameplay involves moving pieces one square at a time unless the piece is frozen or the square is occupied. Control is executed by clicking on a piece to select it, then clicking on the destination square. Each turn allows up to four moves, which can involve moving one piece multiple times or different pieces, as long as the total number of squares moved does not exceed four. Strategic elements include pushing/pulling opponentsâ€™ weaker pieces and avoiding trap squares that remove pieces from play unless supported by adjacent friendly pieces.
